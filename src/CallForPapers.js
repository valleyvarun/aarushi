				<h2>
					Theme: Sex & Horror
				</h2>
				<Grid container xs={12} className={`${styles.container} ${styles.column}`}>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						The employment of human sexuality and gendered human subjectivity have been
						irrefutable tools for horror cinema, since the inception of the genre. Much of horror
						cinema, about human monsters or non-human ones <i>(the other)</i>, about vengeful spirits
						from the past or demonic possession in the present, breeds on irrationality, which in
						psychoanalytic terms, is always sexual in origin and nature. The concept of sexual
						awakening- from the carnal kind (vampirism and cannibalism) which we first saw in
						1931 <i>(Dracula)</i> to ‘sex equals death’- has more often than not been one of the main
						features of most of horror’s sub-genres. The slasher film, a sub-genre of horror, is filled
						right to the brim with sexual connotation to the extent that it encroaches dangerously on
						the pornographic— the key to the genre being the “final girl” trope. Likewise, we find
						unwarranted depictions and stereotypes of gender and sexuality cloaked in a <i>general
						formula</i> found within plots in all sub-genres of horror cinema.
					</p>
					<p className={styles.paragraph}>
						Different places breed different horrors- the term &quot;horror&quot; itself is informed and
						perceived differently, depending on the attitudes and the understanding of not only sex,
						sexuality and gender, but also class, race and caste. The spectre&#39;s hauntings are a product
						of historicity. Horror externalizes the intimate and fragile realms of human sensibilities,
						magnifying terror, fear, and desire to a brash crescendo. What does horror&#39;s treatment of
						sexuality, sex and gender say, if anything at all, about the genre as a product of its time,
						place, and audience? Is there a difference between low brow and artisanal horror
						specifically in how they approach sex as an act, sex as violence, or the gendered body as
						the site of horror?
					</p>
